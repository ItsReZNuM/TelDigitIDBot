## 💡 What is a Telegram Numeric ID?

Every Telegram account has a unique, **unchangeable numeric ID**.  
Unlike usernames or display names, it cannot be modified or deleted, and it remains assigned to your account unless you delete your Telegram profile.

You can use this numeric ID in deep links like:

```
tg://openmessage?user_id=123456789
```

This opens a private chat directly (if permissions allow it).

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- No logging of user data
- Using SQLite For storing user number IDs for sending Bulk message
- Forwarded messages are only used temporarily to extract metadata
